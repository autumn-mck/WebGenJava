# WebGenJava

An application I wrote that I'm currently using to generate most of the static pages on my website (https://mck.is) from markdown to HTML.

### Why Java?

I was learning it at the time, so I wanted to make something with it, and I was already planning to make a project like this at the time. I'm thinking of rewriting it in C++ or Rust over the summer to gain some experience with either of those languages.

### Should anybody else use this?

In its current state? Absolutely no way. It's written to be the bare minimum for what I need, and will probably change drastically as my needs change. It may eventually become more stable, but that's a long way off.
